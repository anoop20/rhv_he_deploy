# FQDN, and address/prefix for provisioned RHVM instance
# FQDN DNS must already resolve to vm_ip_addr (forward and reverse),
# and the address must be in the same public subnet used by all hosts.
# This role assumes that he_fqdn is unique to this deployment, and must
# consist of at least two domain components
# (i.e. do not set this to 'localhost')
# Furthermore, the fqdn must not be the fqdn of the host on which the rhvm VM
# will be provisioned.

# "prefix" is the CIDR netmask prefix; these values are combined to configure
